      <h4>Project Description</h4>
      <p>The wikiHow Redesign is an app that shares how-to instructions for anyone needing information on a wide-range of topics. It removes the pain of vague instructions with a sleek interface that helps you find any topic you need, or even explore other ideas. My role was to research, design, and test out the user interface. I created this project using Figma.</p>

        <h4>Project Goals:</h4>
<p>The goal of this project was to create a new wikiHow app that is easy to maneuver and aesthetically pleasing.</p>

        <h2>The Problem</h2>
        <p>The original wikiHow app had everything from a poor UI design to a mundane style. The app also lacked a lot of the important features for the user that you can find on the website. The way that the app was set up was confusing, and it made it hard to find the information that I wanted. My plan for the redesign was to make the app pleasant to look at, as the user is easily able to explore what the app has to offer.</p>
      </div>
    <div class="researchText square"> 
        <h2>The Research</h2>
        <p>To start off my research, I went on the wikiHow website to find all of the features that were lacking in the app. The website had more features than I knew, so I had to pare down what features I wanted to have in the app.  I also looked at other mobile apps to see what the best kind of UI was for browsing information.  A huge inspiration for the layout was the Pinterest app.</p>

           <h2>Design Contraints</h2>
        <p>The design constraint I set for myself was to use a UI Kit I found on Figna. The UI Kit I chose was the Daresay Mobile UI Kit. The redesign was completely based off of this UI Kit, and I pushed myself to be creative with what I did with it. </p>

           <h2>The Redesign: Version 2</h2>
        <p>Besides creating an easier to follow UI and a more exciting style, the main focus of the redesign was to have the app have the profile features. This was so someone who casually uses the app can bookmark their information, and so they are more likely to continue using the app. All of the other intricate features found on the website would be kept there. I am happy with how the app turned out, and I think it is a great turn around from where we started.</p> </div>

           <h2>Project Challenges</h2>
        <p>The main challenge in this project was to create a UI that was simple, but still offered all of the tools that wikiHow provides. Through many iterations, I was able to create a sleek design that is easy to navigate, without losing any of the important features.</p></div>
