      <h2>Charlotte Murray</h2>

      <p>Charlotte Murray is a senior at Eastern Washington University, where she is majoring in Visual Communication Design and is working on a User Experience Certificate. While in school, Charlotte interned with Laboratory Spokane, an art nonprofit, creating promotion videos and motion animations for their Projection Mapping Showcase.
        Charlotte has many interests ranging from UX/UI design/development to Mixed Reality technologies. Once she graduates, she is planning to start her career as a frontend developer, where she is able to design and code.
        Since Charlotte grew up in a military family and moved around her whole childhood, she is able to view things from more than one perspective and focuses on bringing that into her designs. She plans to gain more experience with web development in the next few years.
        When Charlotte isn't working at her computer, she enjoys listening to music and spending time with friends, family and her two cats.
